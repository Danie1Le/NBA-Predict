# 🏀 NBA Game Outcome Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the outcome of NBA games based on team-level performance statistics during the 2024–2025 season.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses in-season NBA team data to train a classification model that predicts whether a team will win or lose a game. The dataset contains stats such as field goal percentage, assists, rebounds, and game results for each team and game throughout the season.

The goal is **not** to predict future seasons (since rosters change), but to model how a team is performing over time and estimate the likely result of a game using stats **available up to that point**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **End-to-end ML pipeline**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Time-aware validation**: Ensures predictions use only stats prior to the game date.
- **Model explainability**: Feature importance analysis to show which stats matter most for predicting wins.
- **Interactive demo (optional)**: Predict outcomes between two teams and visualize key indicators.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: `NBA_GAMES.csv`  
- Stats per game include:
  - `FG_PCT`, `FG3_PCT`, `FT_PCT` (shooting efficiency)
  - `AST`, `REB`, `MIN` (team activity)
  - `WL`, `W`, `L`, `W_PCT`, `MATCHUP`, `GAME_DATE`, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost** for modeling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **Streamlit** (for exploration or UI)
- *(Optional)* Flask API or Docker for deployment
